- Created basic gameloop
- Keyboard implementation
- Render classification
- Bufferstrategy(3): why not (2) because it's better than a double buffer, and its more fluent with rendering and every system will be able to run it (smoothly)
- Timer (console written)
- FPS meter (in the menu bar)(don't know if it works on linux or mac why: because I simpely don't own a mac or linux pc/laptop)
